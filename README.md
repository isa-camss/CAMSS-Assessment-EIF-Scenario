# CAMSS-Assessment EIF Scenario

The EIF Scenario contains different sections according to the insights and recommendations of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF).

The European Interoperability Framework (EIF) provides guidance to public administrations on how to improve the governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that existing and new legislation does not compromise interoperability efforts. This CAMSS Scenario allows for the assessment of the compliance of interoperability specifications with the EIF. The objective of the obtained assessment is to determine the suitability of the assessed interoperability specification for the delivery of interoperable European public services.
